#3-7. Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.

# Use len() to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.
# Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.
# Use pop() to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. 
# Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know 
# you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.
# Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.
# Use remove to remove the second to last name.  Use del to remove the last name from your list, so 
# you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.
