# 8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a music album. 
# The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing 
# these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
# Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the album information correctly.

# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of 
# songs on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of songs, add that value
# to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of 
# songs on an album.
