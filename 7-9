# appears in the list at least three times. Add code near the beginning of your program to print 
# a message saying the deli has run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all 
# occurrences of 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up in finished_sandwiches.
