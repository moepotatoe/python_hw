# 6-2. Favorite Numbers: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. 

# Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. 
# Think of a favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. 
# Print each person’s name and their favorite number. 

# This method is based on how Slide 9 in the notes completed this task.
# A loop would be more efficeient but I'm guessing that will be a later HW.
# Won't change for now.
