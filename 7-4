# 7-4. Pizza Toppings: Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings 
# until they enter a 'quit' value. As they enter each topping, print a message saying youâ€™ll 
# add that topping to their pizza.

# Use a conditional test in the while statement to stop the loop.
# Use an active variable to control how long the loop runs.
# When complete, print a formatted message that lists the pizza toppings.

active = True
toppings = [ ]
prompt = "Which pizza topping would you like? "

while active:
    order = input(prompt)
    
    if order == 'quit':
        print("Your pizza toppings are: ")
        for x in toppings:
            print(x)
        active = False

    else:
        toppings.append(order)
